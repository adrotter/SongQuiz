# SongQuiz
Quiz program used to study for MUS 106/116 listening quizzes.  Only works on Windows.

To use, download SongQuizlet.exe, and its dependencies: Newtonsoft.Json.dll, Newtonsoft.Json.xml, SpotifyAPI.dll, SpotifyAPI.xml.
You will also need the desktop version of spotify for this to work.


Since this is an EXE program, you might get security warnings from your operating system and anti virus.  It's Ok to proceed, this program does nothing malicious.

Since this program uses the Spotify Web API, you will need to authorize the application to do things on your behalf.  The program does not add or delete anything, it only checks, so do not worry about playlists getting messed up or songs missing, etc.
After each run, the program will authenticate, so it will open a new browser tab to authenticate.  

After authentication, you may get an 404 error from http://localhost:8888.  This is normal, and this does not signfiy a problem.

It's also important to use URI's of playlists and not URLs.
